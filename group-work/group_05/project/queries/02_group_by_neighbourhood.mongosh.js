/**
 * USE CASE: "Host Portfolio & Geographic Spread"
 * * * User Story:
 * "As a market analyst, I want to analyze the portfolio of the 'Lisbon' property
 * management brand. I need to see their full geographic footprint (unique neighbourhoods)
 * and the total volume of their managed inventory to assess their market dominance."
 * * * Technical Goal:
 * Perform a "Filter by Parent" operation. We join the 'listings' with 'hosts',
 * apply a Regex filter on the joined host name, and then perform a global grouping
 * ($group: _id: null) to calculate distinct sets and total counts.
